# About
SimpleLuckyBlock was a mod made with [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), for **version 1.20.1 of Minecraft**. It works by getting a random block from the registry, and gives a random amount of it (0-64) to the player.

# Usage
You can download the ``.jar`` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/FireStreaker2/SimpleLuckyBlock/releases/latest).   

If you would like to compile the code manually, you may also do that.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FireStreaker2/SimpleLuckyBlock.git
$ cd SimpleLuckyBlock
$ ./gradlew build
```
The ``.jar`` file can be found at ``/build/libs/`` when it's done compiling.
